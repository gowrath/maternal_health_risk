# maternal_health_risk
An analysis of maternal risk in a developing country

## Research Question:
How can machine learning methods improve the accuracy and efficiency of maternal health risk classification during pregnancy?

## Why It’s Interesting:
 ~810 maternal and 6,700 newborn deaths daily (WHO).
Many maternal deaths are preventable.
Early, accurate risk prediction can save lives, especially in under-resourced regions.
Deep learning models can run quickly on local devices, no GPU needed.


## Dataset:

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Origin: IoT monitoring systems in rural Bangladesh

Size:
1017 Samples, 7 features 

Variables:
Features: Age, SystolicBP, DiastolicBP, Blood Sugar, Body Temp, Heart Rate
Target: RiskLevel (Low, Mid, High)

Missing Data:
Lacks previous pregnancies, complications, miscarriages
